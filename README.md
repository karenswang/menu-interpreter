# menu-interpreter

## Description
Whether we are ordering food in person or picking restaurants online, menus are one of the most important points of information. However, most menus are designed for general purposes without specific information for people with special dietary needs or preferences. This often results in extra effort to look up dishes online, ask waiters, or spend longer time reading through the entire menu.

“What does a specific menu mean to you?” Our application will give you the answer. We want to build a tool that processes food menus, synthesizes information and provides a summary matching the overall collection of dishes to the users’ personal needs, including allergy history, nutrition needs, diet restrictions, religion, diet preferences, etc. 

This project is still under development. Check out our [clikcable prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/xAeDwOrsWgZgg2KuNgx7E7/Menu-interpreter?type=design&node-id=3-9&t=CtS5OCRIeSJdXqBy-1&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A9&show-proto-sidebar=1&mode=design), [architecture design diagram](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?tags=%7B%7D&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=CloudComputing.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1AbB7MkdI-gUoCcpGZ9RIoe2Lg8VSj7lm%26export%3Ddownload) and our [APIs](./api-swagger.yaml).
